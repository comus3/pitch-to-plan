# pitch-to-plan
IdeaForge is an offline-first mobile app (iOS/Android) to capture ideas quickly and turn them into structured, actionable plans. Users start a chat “interview” with an AI that challenges the idea, asks the right questions, and then generates a complete report (MVP scope, features, architecture, data model, roadmap, risks).
